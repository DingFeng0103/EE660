 The Declaration of Independence‚
The Declaration of Independence of the Thirt‚en Colonies In CONGRE‚S, 
July 4, 1‚76 The unanimous Declaration of the thirt‚en united States of 
America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes nece‚sary for one 
people to di‚solve the political bands which have co‚nected them with 
another, and to a‚sume among the powers of the earth, the separate and 
equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle 
them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they 
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.‚
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that a‚l men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Ha‚pine‚s. That to 
secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their 
just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of 
Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the 
People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying 
its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, 
as to them sha‚l s‚em most likely to e‚fect their Safety and Ha‚pine‚s. 
Prudence, ind‚ed, wi‚l dictate that Governments long established should 
not be changed for light and transient causes; and a‚cordingly a‚l 
experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to su‚fer, while 
evils are su‚ferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to 
which they are a‚customed. But when a long train of abuses and 
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to 
reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their 
duty, to throw o‚f such Government, and to provide new Guards for their 
future security. Such has b‚en the patient su‚ferance of these Colonies; 
and such is now the nece‚sity which constrains them to alter their former 
Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain 
[George ƒI] is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, a‚l 
having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyra‚ny over 
these States. To prove this, let Facts be submi‚ted to a candid world. ‚
He has refused his A‚sent to Laws, the most wholesome and nece‚sary for 
the public g‚od.‚
He has forbi‚den his Governors to pa‚s Laws of i‚mediate and pre‚sing 
importance, unle‚s suspended in their operation ti‚l his A‚sent should be 
obtained, and when so suspended, he has u‚terly neglected to a‚tend to 
them.‚
He has refused to pa‚s other Laws for the a‚co‚modation of large 
districts of people, unle‚s those people would relinquish the right of 
Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and 
formidable to tyrants only.‚
He has ca‚led together legislative bodies at places unusual, 
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, 
for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.‚
He has di‚solved Representative Houses repeatedly, for o‚posing with 
manly firmne‚s his invasions on the rights of the people.‚
He has refused for a long time, after such di‚solutions, to cause others 
to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of A‚nihilation, 
have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State 
remaining in the meantime exposed to a‚l the dangers of invasion from 
without, and convulsions within.‚
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that 
purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing 
to pa‚s others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the 
conditions of new A‚propriations of Lands.‚
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his A‚sent 
to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.‚
He has made Judges dependent on his Wi‚l alone, for the tenure of their 
o‚fices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. ‚
He has erected a multitude of New O‚fices, and sent hither swarms of 
O‚ficers to hara‚s our people, and eat out their substance.‚
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the 
consent of our legislatures.‚
He has a‚fected to render the Military independent of and superior to the 
Civil power.‚
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to 
our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his A‚sent to 
their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed 
tr‚ops amoung us: For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for 
any Murders which they should co‚mit on the Inhabitants of these States: 
For cu‚ting o‚f our Trade with a‚l parts of the world: For imposing Taxes 
on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases of the benefits 
of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for 
pretended o‚fences: For abolishing the fr‚e System of English Laws in a 
neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and 
enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit 
instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: 
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and 
altering fundamenta‚ly the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our 
own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to 
legislate for us in a‚l cases whatsoever.‚
He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection 
and waging War against us.‚
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and 
destroyed the lives of our people.‚
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to 
complete the works of death, desolation and tyra‚ny, already begun with 
circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely para‚leled in the most 
barbarous ages, and tota‚ly unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.‚
He has constrained our fe‚low Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to 
bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their 
friends and Brethren, or to fa‚l themselves by their Hands.‚
He has excited domestic insu‚rections amongst us, and has endeavoured to 
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the mercile‚s Indian Savages, 
whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of a‚l 
ages, sexes and conditions.‚
In every stage of these O‚pre‚sions We have Petitioned for Redre‚s in the 
most humble terms. Our repeated Petitions have b‚en answered only by 
repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act 
which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a fr‚e people.‚
Nor have We b‚en wanting in a‚tentions to our British brethren. We have 
warned them from time to time of a‚tempts by their legislature to extend 
an unwa‚rantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the 
circumstances of our emigration and se‚tlement here. We have a‚pealed to 
their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the 
ties of our co‚mon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would 
inevitably inte‚rupt our co‚nections and co‚respondence. They t‚o have 
b‚en deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, 
therefore, acquiesce in the nece‚sity, which denounces our Separation, 
and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace 
Friends.‚
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in 
General Congre‚s, A‚sembled, a‚pealing to the Supreme Judge of the world 
for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the 
authority of the g‚od People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and 
declare. That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Fr‚e 
and Independent States; that they are Absolved from a‚l A‚legiance to the 
British Crown, and that a‚l political co‚nection betw‚en them and the 
State of Great Britain is and ought to be tota‚ly di‚solved; and that as 
Fr‚e and Independent States, they have fu‚l Power to levy War, conclude 
Peace, contract A‚liances, establish Co‚merce, and to do a‚l other Acts 
and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the su‚port 
of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine 
Providence, we mutua‚ly pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and 
our sacred Honor.
